# lib.reviews

A free/libre code and information platform for reviews of absolutely anything.

See [this libreplanet-discuss post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2016-05/msg00093.html) for background.

Likely initial technical choices:

- Node.js 4+
- Koa or Express as lightweight framework
- MongoDB or RethinkDB as primary backend
- Handlebars for front-end templating
- LESS for CSS
- PureCSS for grid system
- Grunt as a build system
- Mocha as a testing framework
- Babel to transpile ES6+ code
